This work was an assignment in high school where I had to make a simulation of an asteroid approaching the earth. Using the gravitation law I could find its trajectory and display the distance between the earth and the asteroid at each frame. By doing so, we could find whether the asteroid would destroy the earth or not. This was done using MAPLE, a program to do calculations and graphics
